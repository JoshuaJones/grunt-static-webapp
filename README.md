# grunt-static-webapp

> Create a simple starting point for static web projects with [grunt-init][].

[grunt-init]: http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding
[h5bp]: https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate
[yeoman]: http://yeoman.io/

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/JoshuaJones/grunt-static-webapp.git ~/.grunt-init/static-webapp
```

_(Windows users, see [the documentation][grunt-init] for the correct destination directory path)_

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init static-webapp
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._

If you are familar with [h5bp][] or [Yeoman][], you should feel at home.
